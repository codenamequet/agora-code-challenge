            <p>According to a recent animal study published in the European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology, the answer is yes!</p>
            <p>Here’s how:</p>
            <p>Scientists have discovered keeping your blood sugar healthy boils down to a simple enzyme in your body.</p>
            <p>If this enzyme is shut down, that leads to…</p>     
            <p>&#10003 Concerning <b>insulin levels…</b></p>
            <p>&#10003 Struggling to keep your <b>HbA1c</b> in the normal range…</p>
            <p>&#10003 Or frustration with your <b>belly fat</b> <b>and fatigue…</b></p>

        <p class="brown-bar-p1">You might even get a thumbs up from your doctor, after confirming your HbA1c is the best it’s been in years…</p>
        <p class="brown-bar-p2">And also hear from your doctor that whatever you’ve been doing to lose those extra pounds: <i>“Keep it up, because it’s working like crazy!”</i></p>

    <section class="explanation">
        <p>So what does this have to do with eating chocolate?</p> 
        <p>Simple… it turns out you can activate this enzyme by eating chocolate! Seriously!</p> 
        <p>If you’re skeptical, I completely understand. And why wouldn’t you be?</p>
